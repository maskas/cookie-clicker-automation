This little script plays CookieClicker (http://orteil.dashnet.org/cookieclicker/) game for you.

Just open browsers javascript console and paste javascript code into it from cookieclicker.js file. Enjoy cookies to be collected for you.

NO BRUTEFORCE DISCLAIMER
The script clicks the cookie just first 100 times to get the game rolling. The rest is done only by buying upgrades in a relatively efficient way. Maybe it is not 100% mathematically the most efficient player, but much smarter than average cookie clickerer :DDD
I challenge you to beat this script by only buying upgrades.
